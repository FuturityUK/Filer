To DO:

- reset database function
  - only call it after the user has requested it
  - Show filename
  - Show path
  - Double check by asking the user to type 'reset'

- import function
  - Fix the function to import of file system listing from the fwf file.
  - Split the "combined" "make,model,serial-number" string and update the separate make, model and serial-number variables
  - take the file system label
  - check if the label exists in the file system table and if it does, ask the user if they want to replace the entries for it
  - if not update the file systems table to obtain the id of this new label
  - store the file system id for each of its file system entries
  - add hostname, make, model, serial
  - record file types
  - store sizes of directories
  - add files to exclude from the directory size calculations like thumbnails, apple directory cache files (get list from other programs)
  - is it faster to delete all records for a file_system and insert all files, or to check to see if a file exists and update it only if necessary?
  - if updating a file system's files, remember to delete the files that are in the database but not in the file system listing.

- add '-y' functionality to turn off interactive questions and go with defaults
  - for all questions, make sure that the defaults are shown
- 'list-file-systems' subcommand
- 'find' subcommand
- 'duplicates' subcommand
